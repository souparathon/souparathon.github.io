# About

I am a third year computer science student who is passionate about exploring the great potential technology has for helping people learn, connect, and ascend to great heights. I strive for understanding, gaining insight, and developing keen judgement. I value the experiences and perspectives of others and navigating the unknown and ambiguous aspects of life to find clarity.
